### Hash flooding

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Collision_attack&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Hash flooding")]

**Hash flooding** (also known as **HashDoS**[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_attack#cite_note-15)) is a [denial of service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial_of_service "Denial of service") attack that uses hash collisions to exploit the worst-case (linear probe) runtime of [hash table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table "Hash table") lookups.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_attack#cite_note-v8-16) It was originally described in 2003. To execute such an attack, the attacker sends the server multiple pieces of data that hash to the same value and then tries to get the server to perform slow lookups. As the main focus of hash functions used in hash tables was speed instead of security, most major programming languages were affected,[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_attack#cite_note-17) with new vulnerabilities of this class still showing up a decade after the original presentation.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_attack#cite_note-v8-16)

To prevent hash flooding without making the hash function overly complex, newer [keyed hash functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyed_hash_function "Keyed hash function") are introduced, with the security objective that collisions are hard to find as long as the key is unknown. They may be slower than previous hashes, but are still much easier to compute than cryptographic hashes. As of 2021, Jean-Philippe Aumasson and [Daniel J. Bernstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_J._Bernstein "Daniel J. Bernstein")'s [SipHash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SipHash "SipHash") (2012) is the most widely-used hash function in this class.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_attack#cite_note-SipHash-18) (Non-keyed "simple" hashes remain safe to use as long as the application's hash table is not controllable from the outside.)

It is possible to perform an analogous attack to fill up [Bloom filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter "Bloom filter") using a (partial) preimage attack.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_attack#cite_note-19)
