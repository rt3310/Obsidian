## Arithmetic & Logic Unit
### Roles of ALU
- Does the (integer arithmetic) computations
- Everything else in the computer is there to service this unit
### FPU (floating point unit)
- Arithmetic unit that handles floating point (real) numbers
- Operations on separate floating point registers
### Implementation
- All microprocessors has integer ALUs
- Most of recent microprocessors including chips now has on-chip FPU
